This is the recipe, in order to match the taste, follow it STEP by STEP
1. Take a normal sized bowl made of either steel or porcelain
2. Fill it 1/3 to 1/2 if you are not a fan of soupy noodles, but if you are, fill it 1/2 to 2/3 with either tap water or purified water.
3. Break the noodle as much or as less as you want, but it is recommended to break it AT LEAST once. 
4. After you do that just put the noodle into the bowl.
5. Now that you have done the previous states, put the MAGGIE masala into the bowl.
6. Put some Mozzarela Cheese into the bowl as per your taste.
7. After you have done that, put the bowl into the microwave and spin it for 2 minutes.
8. Don't take the bowl out of the microwave after it is done, just wait for another minute or two so that the Maggie takes its perfect form.
9. After the time for settling of the Maggie is over, then take it out and put in the indian butter.
10. Mix up the maggie carefully, and then enjoy the taste!!!
